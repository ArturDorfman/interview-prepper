### What is Nuxt.js, and how does it differ from Vue.js?
Nuxt.js is a framework that extends Vue.js by offering server-side rendering,
automatic routing, and a modular structure.
Unlike Vue.js, Nuxt.js provides a convention-based setup,
reducing the need for manual configuration and making it well-suited for scalable applications.

### Explain the concept of server-side rendering (SSR) in Nuxt.js.
Server-side rendering in Nuxt.js means rendering Vue components on the server,
resulting in faster page loads and improved SEO.
This is achieved by pre-rendering HTML content on the server and sending it to the client.

### What is server-side rendering (SSR) and how does Nuxt.js implement it?
Server-side rendering in Nuxt.js means rendering Vue components on the server, sending pre-rendered HTML to the client.
Nuxt.js implements SSR by default,
making it easy for developers to achieve server-side rendering without the need for extensive configuration.
This results in improved performance, better SEO, and faster initial page loads.

### How does Nuxt.js handle routing?
Nuxt.js handles routing by automatically generating routes from files in the 'pages' directory.
Each .vue file in 'pages' corresponds to a route, allowing for a straightforward and organized routing structure.

### What are Nuxt.js plugins, and how do you use them?
Nuxt.js plugins are functions or modules that run before the main Vue.js application is created.
They are beneficial for integrating third-party libraries, adding global functionality,
or performing tasks that need to happen before the application starts.x

### In what ways can you use Nuxt?
Nuxt can be used as a static site generator,
a server-side rendering framework, or a traditional single-page application.
It is also frequently used with headless CMS systems to create dynamic, content-driven websites.

### What are some common use cases for Nuxt?
Nuxt is a popular framework for creating Universal applications,
which are applications that can be run on both the server and the client.
This makes Nuxt ideal for applications that need to be fast and responsive,
such as e-commerce applications or applications that need to load data quickly.
 
### Whatâ€™s the difference between the _nuxt folder and dist folder?
The _nuxt folder is where the Nuxt application is built and compiled,
while the dist folder is the folder that is actually deployed.
The _nuxt folder is not meant to be deployed, but rather is only meant for development purposes.

### What is the best way to load external libraries in your Nuxt app?
The best way to load external libraries in your Nuxt app is to use the nuxt-external-module module.
This module will allow you to specify which libraries you want to load and will automatically load them for you.

### How does Nuxt.js handle asynchronous data fetching?
Nuxt comes with two composables and a built-in library to perform data-fetching in browser or server environments:
* useFetch
  * useFetch is the most straightforward way to handle data fetching in a component setup function.

* useAsyncData
  * useAsyncData, combined with $fetch, offers more fine-grained control.

* $fetch
  * $fetch is great to make network requests based on user interaction.

We should remember that we still can use axios for data fetching. It depends on a specific use case.

### Explain the concept of middleware in Nuxt.js.
Middleware in Nuxt.js allows developers to execute code before rendering pages.
Whether it's authentication checks, logging,
or data fetching, middleware provides a powerful tool to customize the request-handling process.
It can be applied globally or to specific pages, offering flexibility in managing different aspects of the application.

### What is the purpose of layouts in Nuxt.js?
Layouts in Nuxt.js play a crucial role in defining the overall structure of our application's pages.
They contain common elements like headers, footers, and navigation bars,
providing a way to maintain a consistent UI across different pages.
Using layouts ensures a unified and professional look for the entire application.

### How can you optimize the performance of a Nuxt.js application?
To optimize the performance of a Nuxt.js application,
one can employ strategies like code splitting to reduce initial load times, lazy loading for efficient resource usage,
and maximizing the benefits of server-side rendering.
Additionally, minimizing the use of large external libraries can contribute to a smoother and faster user experience.

### What is the purpose of the Nuxt.config.js file?
The Nuxt.config.js file is the configuration file for Nuxt.js projects.
It acts as a central hub for configuring various aspects of the project,
including modules, plugins, build settings, and other options.
This file provides a structured and organized way to manage project-wide configurations.

### Explain the concept of serverMiddleware in Nuxt.js.
ServerMiddleware in Nuxt.js provides a way to incorporate custom server-side logic into our application.
It's beneficial for tasks like API integration or handling specific server-side functionality.
This allows us to perform tasks on the server before the content reaches the client,
enhancing the overall functionality of the application.

### How does Nuxt.js handle error pages?
Nuxt.js streamlines the handling of error pages
by enabling developers to create custom error layouts and pages for different HTTP status codes.
This can be done conveniently in the layouts/error directory,
allowing us to tailor the user experience for various error scenarios.

### What is the purpose of the asyncData method in Nuxt.js?
The asyncData method in Nuxt.js is designed for asynchronous data fetching before rendering a page.
It runs on the server side before the component is created,
making it suitable for scenarios where data needs to be available during server-side rendering.
This ensures a seamless user experience with pre-rendered data.

### Explain the concept of watchQuery in Nuxt.js.
In Nuxt.js, the watchQuery property enables us to specify a list of query parameters to monitor for changes.
When these parameters change, the associated method is triggered,
allowing us to reactively respond to changes in the query string.
This is particularly useful for scenarios where dynamic actions are required based on URL query parameter changes.

### How does Nuxt.js support internationalization (i18n)?
Nuxt.js facilitates internationalization through its built-in i18n module.
This module streamlines the process of implementing multi-language support by handling translations,
routes, and locale-specific content.
It provides a convenient solution for developers looking to create applications that cater to a global audience.

### Can you explain the concept of lazy loading in Nuxt.js?
Lazy loading in Nuxt.js is a technique where resources like components or modules are loaded only when they are needed.
This optimization strategy contributes to improved performance by reducing the initial payload size
and deferring the loading of resources until they are required,
resulting in a faster and more efficient user experience.

### How does Nuxt.js handle SEO optimization?
Nuxt.js prioritizes SEO optimization through built-in features like server-side rendering (SSR),
automatic generation of meta tags, and the option to customize meta-information for each page.
These features collectively contribute to better search engine visibility and ranking,
ensuring that your Nuxt.js applications are well-optimized for SEO.

### What is the purpose of the NuxtLink component in Nuxt.js?
The NuxtLink component serves the purpose of facilitating client-side navigation between pages in a Nuxt.js application.
It is an improved version of Vue Router's router-link,
offering additional features like automatic active class management and link prefetching.
NuxtLink simplifies the process of creating navigation links and enhances the overall user experience.

### How can you deploy a Nuxt.js application?
Nuxt.js applications can be deployed on a variety of hosting platforms.
Common choices include traditional servers, cloud services like AWS or Azure,
and specialized platforms for static site deployment such as Netlify or Vercel.
The choice depends on factors like scalability, ease of use, and specific project requirements.

### How can you optimize the performance of a Nuxt.js application for SEO?
To optimize the performance of a Nuxt.js application for SEO,
it's crucial to leverage server-side rendering (SSR) for dynamic content.
Additionally, crafting descriptive and concise meta-tags, along with maintaining a clear and organized site structure,
plays a significant role in enhancing the application's visibility and ranking on search engines.
