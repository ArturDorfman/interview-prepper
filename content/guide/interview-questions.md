### Soft Skills
#### What do you know about Conversation-starting Techniques?
1. Ask Open-Ended Questions
   * Instead of asking questions that can be answered with a simple "yes" or "no," ask open-ended questions that encourage people to share more about themselves.

2. Compliment
   * Give a genuine (true) compliment to start the conversation on a positive note. It could be about someone's appearance, an accomplishment, or something you genuinely appreciate.

3. Share Something Personal
   * Opening up a bit about yourself can make others feel more comfortable doing the same. Share a relevant personal story or experience.

4. Use Humor
   * Humor can break the ice and make people feel more at ease. Just be mindful of the context and the other person's sense of humor. (Use with caution!) 

5. Find Common Ground
   * Look for shared interests, experiences, or mutual connections. Finding common ground helps establish a connection from the beginning.

6. Ask for Advice
   * Seeking advice is a great way to involve others in the conversation. It shows that you value their opinion and can lead to interesting discussions.

   * Discussing current events or topics of mutual interest can provide a natural starting point for a conversation.

8. Use F.O.R.D. Technique
   * F.O.R.D. stands for Family, Occupation, Recreation, and Dreams. These are safe and common topics that can lead to meaningful conversations.

9. Start with a Question
   * Begin the conversation by directly asking the other person a question. This immediately involves them and gives them a reason to respond.

10. Be a Good Listener
    * Sometimes, starting a conversation involves listening. Respond thoughtfully to what others are saying, and it can naturally lead to a more extended discussion.

Remember, the key to successful conversations is to be genuine, respectful, and attentive to the other person's responses. Adjust your approach based on the context and the individual you're engaging with.
