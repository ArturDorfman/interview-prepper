# Algorithms and data structures

---

### What is algorithmic complexity and how to evaluate it?
### Explain basic data structures such as arrays, lists, stacks, and queues.
### What sorting algorithms do you know and how do they work?
### How to implement breadth-first search and depth-first search on a graph and where is it needed on the frontend?
### What is recursion, give examples of its use.
### How can algorithms be optimized with the help of memoization?
### What search algorithms do you know and how do they differ from each other?
### How does a hash table work and what are its advantages and disadvantages?
### Explain tree algorithms such as binary search tree.
### What algorithms can be used to find the shortest path in a graph?

### What non-trivial data structures have you worked with or know about?
### Tell us about CRDT.
### What optimization algorithms were used to improve the performance of large applications?
### Which sorting algorithms do you think are the most efficient for processing large data sets?
### How do you use dynamic programming in real projects? Give an example.
### Discuss practical uses of data structures such as AVL trees or red-black trees.
